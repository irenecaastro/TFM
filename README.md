# Introduction
In this repository, we will work in an R environment using RStudio for the analysis of sc-RNA-seq data following Seurat Guided Clustering Tutorial. Data can be accessed on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under the accession number GSE209792 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE209792).
# Pipeline Description
- Step 1: From two cell and gene annotation dataframes and one sparse-matrix, we create a Seurat object. 
- Step 2: Cell filtering.
- Step 3: Normalization, feature selection, scaling, PCA, Clustering and non-linar dimensional reduction (UMAP).
- Step 4: Integration of the data due to presence of bactch effect.
- Step 5: Reclustering and cluster characterization of ExE. GO enrichment analysis of the cluster markers.
- Step 6: Cell proportion of early and later stages across clusters in ExE.
- Step 7: Pseudo-bulk differential expression analysis using NE as a control in ExE clusters. GO enrichment analysis of DEGs.
